For high enough energies, MNC and MBH trajectories\\ can escape.\\MBH trajectories can also be captured by the black hole\\Near regions with ordered escape structure,\\ escape times are generally higher\\There exists initial conditions with escaping energies that\\do not escape, which produces trapped orbits\\Energy is not the only determining factor for escape.\\
